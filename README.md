# Flickr to Wordpress Uploader

**WORK IN PROGRESS, USE AT OWN RISK!!!**

This project might go nowhere, but I thought I'd give it a try...

Flickr is changing their retention policy and I have a fair number of photos there, organized into albums. I've [downloaded all of the photos and metadata](https://jpreardon.com/2019/01/13/flickr-download/), so now the question is what to do with them. I want to have them online, but I don't want to rely on another service that might go away someday. I have a Wordpress site, so I'm going to try to use that. Wish me luck.

Check out the [worklog](worklog.md) for progress.
